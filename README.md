# Helsinki-City-bike-stations-Origin-Destination-OD-data
Analyzing and Visualizing Helsinki City bike stationsâ€™ Origin-Destination (OD) data using Microsoft Power BI platform. This is an open source data taken from <a href="https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-ja-espoon-kaupunkipyorilla-ajatut-matkat">open source dataset from avoindata.fi</a>.

## Project Description
City-bike-stations-Origin-Destination-OD-data contains bike stations, origin to destination, covered distances(m), duration(sec) per trip. The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize the information to find trends or changes over time.
</br>The project was carried out using the Micrsoft Power BI platform.</br>
The steps applied included reading and transforming the dataset in Power Query editor, a component of the Power BI Desktop.</br>
Codes were written in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/dax-overview">DAX(Data Analysis Expressions), a formula expression language used in Analysis Services, Power BI, Power Pivot and Excel</a>

After data transformation, the next stage was asking the right questions such as:
<dl>
  <dt>Which bike origin station is popular</dt>
  <i><dd>---by week days and weekends</dd></i>
  <i><dd>---by leaving hour of the day</dd></i>
  <i><dd>---by maximum distance travelled</dd></i>
  <i><dd>---per day trip date</dd></i>
  <i><dd>---destination from starting point</dd></i>
  ...<i><strong>AND</strong></i> future insights questions as to what makes an origin or destination location popular, by using a map visualizations.
  For example the presence of a pub, grocessry stories, opening and closing times within the week.

Based on the analysis, measures can be taken into account as to which station/depots needs more bikes.
